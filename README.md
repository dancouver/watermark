This is a desktop image watermarking application built with Python and tkinter.

The tool allows you to upload a JPG or PNG image, enter custom text, and apply it as a semi-transparent watermark centered on the image. 
The script dynamically calculates the appropriate font size to ensure the text fits neatly within the image's width.
After processing, it saves the new watermarked image in the same directory with a "-wm" suffix and automatically opens the file for immediate viewing. 
It's a simple, user-friendly solution for quickly adding watermarks to your images.
